# WP Scripts Demo Plugin

This is an exploration of how we can use the `@wordpress/wp-scripts` package when building blocks.

Setup: `npm install`

Use:

* `npm start` to start a dev environment that watches JS changes and rebuilds.
* `npm run build` to build JS files into `build/index.js`.
* `npm run lint:js` to lint JS files in `src/`.
* `npm run lint:css` to lint CSS files in `src/`.
